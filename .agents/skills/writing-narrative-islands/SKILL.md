# Narrative Islands

Build **narrative islands**: bounded, causally live situations that give
players meaningful things to pursue without prescribing the route.

**Island** is the method. The page is `kind: situation` when another
page, a future session, or a Beat Chart must refer to this topology as
a node. A night-only pressure stays a session-plan Situations section.
There is no `kind: narrative-island`.

The island owns **situation topology**: what is happening, who wants
what, why it matters, how it changes, how the PCs can engage, and what
changes afterward. The players choose the route.

## Method

Three states:

- **True:** established canon or explicit DM ruling.
- **Possible:** prepared pressure, clues, options, or consequences.
- **Happened:** events established through play evidence.

Unused preparation has no authority over play. Improvisation that lands
at the table outranks unused prep.

Legal prep: an NPC makes an offer; a faction searches; a storm drives
ships off course; a clue exists in three discoverable forms.

Seed broadly, observe play, identify attention, deepen selectively.

A Live Branches row on the Beat Chart is legal only when the party's
own choice creates materially different future situations — the collapse
test in `writing-session-beats/references/audits.md`. If outcomes
reconverge, collapse them into one beat.

## Core model

Think in an **archipelago**, not a plot chain. An island contains:

- a live **situation**
- competing **forces** with independent goals
- **gravity** that can attract the PCs
- several **bridges**
- useful **affordances**
- a **tide** that changes the situation when ignored
- several possible **state changes**
- a **wake** into the wider campaign

Prepare what the world **does**. Discover what the PCs **do** at the table.

## Workflow

Element catalogs and the audit: `references/workflow-detail.md`.

### 1. Load the current world

Search the compiled vault. Read the smallest set of pages for PC goals,
active factions, unresolved hooks, locations, clocks, and recent state
changes.

**Complete when** every reused fact traces to current canon and every
new fact is identifiable as new prep.

### 2. State the situation

**[Forces] want [incompatible things] in or around [context] before
[pressure matures].** Define the dramatic question. Test at least three
materially different end states.

**Complete when** the sentence names incompatible wants and a maturing
pressure.

### 3. Establish gravity

Connect to existing PC goals, fears, loyalties, and interests. Prefer
multiple weak pulls over one compulsory hook. Declining remains
legitimate.

**Complete when** engagement follows from things the PCs already value.

### 4. Build active forces

Every load-bearing actor: want, reason, constraint, leverage, next
action, tell. Every major force can advance the situation without the
party.

**Complete when** no load-bearing actor waits politely for the PCs.

### 5. Build bridges

At least two materially different entry vectors (three or four is
strong). Losing one bridge does not erase the island.

**Complete when** two bridges remain after any one is lost.

### 6. Prepare affordances

What PCs can manipulate **in this situation**. Durable physical logic
belongs on the spatial page — invoke `writing-places` when the place
cannot be run. If an obstacle has only one answer, add an affordance
or remove the gate.

**Complete when** unscripted combinations can change the situation.

### 7. Set the tide

The smallest useful progression for when PCs are elsewhere. For each
step: cause, what changes, visible evidence, what opens or closes.

**Complete when** ignoring the island still changes the world.

### 8. Add candidate beats

Attach beats to triggers or states, not timestamps. Delegate craft to
`writing-session-beats` and the `writing-*-beats` skills.

**Complete when** candidate beats remain conditional.

### 9. Define state changes

Consequence logic, not endings. Who gains leverage, what becomes true
or impossible, who learns, which clocks and bridges change.

**Complete when** more than one persistent state is possible.

### 10. Write the wake

Propagate into NPCs, factions, other situations, reputation.

**Complete when** the island points toward more than one future situation.

### 11. Write the page

Mint `kind: situation` from `_system/schemas/situation/template.md`
when the threshold is met. Otherwise write the same topology into the
session-plan Situations section. If a place the island occupies is
missing or unplayable, invoke `writing-places` first — or
`writing-dungeons` when it is a multi-room dungeon complex. If a notable
object must be cited as a node and has no page, invoke `writing-items`.
If a named conveyance must be cited as a node and has no page, invoke
`writing-vehicles`. If a node exists but has no presence, invoke
`fleshing-out-content`.

List playable `kind: location` sites in `locations:`; wikilink other
spatial kinds in the body.

**Complete when** a DM can scan the page and run the situation.

### 12. Run the island audit

`references/workflow-detail.md`: agency, causality, activity,
connectivity, gravity, persistence, vault integrity.

**Complete when** every audit question has a concrete answer in the
page or current canon.

## Cold opens

A cold open is authored by `writing-cold-opens`. An island that opens
on one delegates the whole frame to that skill.

## Done check

`NI: <situation premise + pressure + if-ignored change + table-open question>`
