# Cold Open Page

The written artifact: the page skeleton, this repo's beat-page integration, and
wiki conventions. The workflow lives in `../SKILL.md`.

## Repo integration

A cold open is one Hook beat page, instantiated from the beat template in
`_system/schemas/` at `canon: provisional`, and composed against its session's
Beat Chart by `writing-session-beats`.

- Each step is **narration, then one `[!mechanic]`** whose table holds the group
  row (`the DM visual language in CONTEXT.md/references/check.md` § Group check). The DM
  ruling at `the campaign's established group-check ruling, if one exists` binds the mechanic: a
  cold-open step resolves on one combined group check — five d20s, one per
  player seat, named-skill modifiers, summed — never five individual checks.
- **Pass** and **Fail** read `if the party does X` / `if they do not`. The
  borrowed body is the subject of the narration, never a named-PC choreography.
- Address the borrowed NPCs by their established names.
- **Next** carries two labeled landings. A mid-chain Fail that ends the open
  links its Fail landing on that step.
- The cold open's own short story, when it has one, is a `[!narration]`
  on the beat page. Present tense. The borrowed body is the subject.
  Craft: `theatre-of-the-mind`.

Steps 2 through 5 repeat step 1's five fields.

## Wiki conventions

Keep DM-facing notes short enough to run straight from the page at the table.

Use `[[wikilinks]]` for established entities instead of repeating their lore.
Pull detail from the entity's own page when a step needs it, rather than
copying a second authoritative description into the cold open.
