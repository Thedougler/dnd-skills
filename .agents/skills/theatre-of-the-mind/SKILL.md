# Theatre of the mind

This is the default and sole authority for prose that crosses the DM/player
boundary. It covers a live sentence, a boxed passage, a chat reply, a recap,
a combat update, a handout, and player-safe rendered text. Keep DM procedure
and hidden truth outside that prose in `[!mechanic]` and collapsed
`[!secret]-` callouts.

Narration controls attention. Give the player a concrete thing, body, or
change they can point at and act on. Length follows the moment and the surface;
a first look may be a paragraph, while a hit or dialogue turn may be one line.
Stop at the next meaningful player opening. Do not force every surface into a
spoken block, a fixed beat, or a located change.

When the user requests a full or loaded first look, produce one coherent spoken
block containing every relevant subject and relationship currently perceivable:
locations and routes, NPCs, creatures, items, and current motion. Attention
hierarchy and fold keep that block drawable; the anchor ceiling is a selection
aid, never permission to omit relevant visible facts. Exclude hidden items,
unearned identities or mechanics, future action, and player choice. A partial
doorway snapshot is appropriate only when the user explicitly asks for that
limited view.

## Choose the mode

Before surface routing, decide whether the request is a **situated moment** or a
**standalone portrait**:

- **Situated moment:** write from the supplied table state and viewpoint. Route
  by surface below, preserve the current environment and motion, and stop at
  that surface's natural player opening.
- **Standalone portrait:** describe one item, creature, place, vehicle,
  business, person, or other subject as a self-contained player reference. Do
  not invent a party, encounter, specific environment, viewer or camera,
  current motion, interaction, dialogue, pressure, handoff, or “what do you
  do?” It is not scene staging and does not need a located change. Hierarchically
  convey all relevant established player-visible identity: recognizable whole
  or silhouette and scale; defining parts, material, or body; ordinary visible
  behavior, function, or use when canon supplies it; and one signature sensory
  fact when the supplied canon supports one. Places add neutral form, topology,
  landmarks, and approaches; businesses add established purpose, interface, and
  service signature; people add a stable
  Face and established characteristic behavior; vehicles add stable silhouette,
  scale, components, and operational character. Omit hidden truth, private
  mechanics, unearned lore, and absent or contradictory facts. Use a public or
  earned name only when known; an unknown name stays unknown.

The default standalone portrait is a cold player-appearance and observable-state
layer, even when the owning parent is addressed to `[agent, dm]`. Include all
established descriptive states needed for recognition, but omit exact effects,
durations, speeds, actions, DCs, rarity, attunement, curses, private biology or
history, tactics, hidden causes, learned route rules, and secret identities.
If the user explicitly requests identified or player-known properties, render
those mechanics separately after the description and only within that granted
knowledge state. “Complete” means complete for the target portrait contract,
never every heading in the parent.

After one reading of a standalone portrait, a player should be able to
recognize, picture, and distinguish the subject, and know its ordinary
observable function or behavior when the supplied canon supports one. The
wrapper follows the host or page request; do not force an encounter question.

## Before drafting

1. Identify the mode and surface, then read
   [references/surfaces.md](references/surfaces.md) before writing. It is the
   routing contract and defines the natural stop. A standalone portrait uses
   its portrait contract rather than a situated spatial camera.
2. Read [references/examples.md](references/examples.md) and
   [references/voice.md](references/voice.md). Read the matching specialist
   reference and one other: [places.md](references/places.md) for spatial jobs,
   [humans.md](references/humans.md) for objects, [experts.md](references/experts.md)
   for creatures or fights, and [npcs.md](references/npcs.md) for people or
   dialogue.
   A business, shop, tavern, or service request uses the Business row in
   [surfaces.md](references/surfaces.md); no other reference authorizes filling
   missing stock or layout.
3. Read the owning parent and current table state. Preserve established and
   locked canon, distinguish beliefs from facts, and do not add canon in this
   prose pass. If the parent lacks a usable signature, first-sight facts, or
   affordance, invoke the owning craft skill before drafting.
4. Run the evidence-of-access and hidden-truth checks in
   [references/boundary.md](references/boundary.md). Every player-facing
   detail needs a legitimate access channel. An uncertainty marker may label
   only an inference grounded in named evidence; it cannot create access.
   Without a channel, cut the detail or route to the owning content-stock
   skill.
5. Before drafting from an owning parent or reference, make a terse fact
   inventory in fragmentary keywords only, with provenance and access; never
   copy source sentences into that inventory. Set source and reference prose
   aside, group the facts by the target contract rather than source order, and
   draft with a different subject order, syntax, verbs, and comparisons. Compare
   the result against the parent and every read expert excerpt for suspicious
   phrase or sentence overlap, recognizable clauses, distinctive metaphors,
   callouts, or matching section order across paragraphs. Rewrite; merely
   swapping synonyms sentence by sentence is not enough. “Copy the move, leave
   the setting” means technique only, never wording. The only narrow exception
   is an established in-world quotation, inscription, or document the user
   explicitly asks to reproduce verbatim; identify its owner and quotation then.
   Expert examples in references are analysis examples, not lines to echo into
   generated prose.

## Invariants across surfaces

- Use a plain noun and a concrete verb first. Add at most one unusual
  comparison when it makes the thing memorable. Give one setting-specific
  signature property — material, practice, sound, behavior, or contradiction —
  to a usable noun or affordance. Generic mood must come from evidence.
- Characters perceive; players interpret. Never narrate a PC's feeling,
  thought, choice, route, conclusion, or unresolved outcome. Show stimulus,
  behavior, and consequence, then leave the response to the table.
- Keep facts within the current viewpoint, established automatic knowledge,
  a declared and resolved interaction, or earned public canon. A permissible
  inference must follow from named perceivable evidence or established
  knowledge; “maybe” does not make an invented detail safe. Source silence is
  not permission to fill a gap with genre defaults. Do not let vivid language
  smuggle in an unearned interior, history, function, magic, motive, or rule.
- Source wording is not player-facing canon. Preserve supported facts while
  materially rephrasing parent and reference prose; retain only proper names,
  necessary measurements, and irreducible game terms when paraphrase would
  change identity or accuracy. Explicitly requested in-world quotations are the
  sole narrow exception.
- Use the branch's tense, wrapper, and shape. A player-safe surface contains no
  `[!secret]-` material, hidden certainty, DC, HP, condition, or other private
  procedure. Reread it as a player who cannot rewind.

## Spatial work

Place, encounter, travel, and vehicle writing use the spatial camera and
staging method in [references/surfaces.md](references/surfaces.md) and
[references/places.md](references/places.md). Within that branch, seat one
camera, choose one frame, relate landmarks to it, and keep distances and
units consistent. For a spatial first look, a stranger should be able to say
where they are, what they see, what is moving, and what matters now. A located
change is a useful live handle, not a mandatory ending when the scene has no
current movement.

The spatial staging card is a private drafting aid: stage, near, far, block,
three to five anchors, and the current opening. Audit visible entrances,
exits, retreat, cover, blocked paths, and traversable hazards whenever those
facts affect a decision. Introduce each landmark once, then reuse it.

For a requested full or loaded spatial first look, complete the current visible
state in that one block before stopping: include every relevant visible subject,
relationship, route, and motion, while leaving hidden items and future outcomes
out. Stop after that complete state at its pressure or opening. Only an
explicitly requested doorway-only snapshot may be intentionally partial.

## Draft and review

Choose the branch, select the facts that pass the boundary, and draft only to
its natural stop. Keep a signature property tied to an affordance, not floating
as decoration. Read the result aloud once. Ask the branch's questions from
[references/surfaces.md](references/surfaces.md), then run the slop and thin
gates in [references/voice.md](references/voice.md). Cut isolated details,
private metaphors, premature labels, unsupported mechanics, and future
outcomes; add the missing noun, relationship, access, or opening when the
player cannot act on the line.

For spatial narration, use third person and present tense by default. For
other surfaces, follow their contract: dialogue can be quoted, recaps use
past tense, and handouts retain their diegetic owner's voice. Draft layers,
staging cards, analysis, and routing labels stay off the player-facing page.
