# Season Architecture

Full construction method for step 4 of the campaign-planning workflow.
Season pages are `kind: season` pages owned by
`_system/schemas/season/` — this reference covers the
architectural decisions that produce them, not their page format.

## What a season is

A season is a major phase of campaign play with its own scale, identity,
dramatic question, dominant pressures, approximate advancement range,
narrative function, and transition into what might follow.

Seasons are simultaneously:

1. **Advancement-scale tools** — tracking changes in character capability
2. **Narrative tools** — marking meaningful changes in what the campaign
   is about

## D&D tier heuristic

Use the tiers of play as an initial scaling heuristic, not compulsory
boundaries:

- Tier 1: levels 1–4
- Tier 2: levels 5–10
- Tier 3: levels 11–16
- Tier 4: levels 17–20

Early tier transitions make convenient season boundaries because
capability and scale change rapidly. As advancement slows, later
seasons may occupy part of a tier, cross a tier boundary, split one
tier into multiple seasons, or remain at the same level range for
substantial play.

Narrative transformation determines the boundary; levels help estimate
its scale.

## Season boundary tests

A new season is justified when one or more major dimensions materially
change:

- The central question
- The party's operating scale
- The primary theater of play
- The dominant pressure
- The political order
- The party's role in the world
- The type of problems their power allows them to confront
- The consequences inherited from the previous season

Level advancement alone does not require a new season.

## Length estimation

Use the campaign runtime to constrain the season architecture. Allocate
rough proportions rather than exact quotas.

Consider: number of levels expected, advancement pace, complexity of
central situations, time for character relationships and side pursuits,
sandbox exploration, play frequency, whether higher-level advancement
slows.

Example:

```text
Campaign target: ~70 sessions

Season 1 — ~12–16 sessions
Season 2 — ~18–22 sessions
Season 3 — ~20–25 sessions
Season 4 / Endgame — remaining play, highly provisional
```

These numbers expose mismatches. If four planned seasons each appear to
require thirty sessions inside a sixty-session campaign, resolve the
contradiction with the DM now. Do not hide impossible scope behind
vague prose.

## Narrative function

Each season needs a reason to exist beyond occupying levels. Describe
its function in one sentence. Useful functions include:

- Establishing the world and party
- Discovering the true scale of a problem
- Widening the sandbox
- Forcing the party into the political order
- Transforming local consequences into regional ones
- Revealing deeper history behind current conflicts
- Allowing player-created alliances to reshape the setting
- Bringing accumulated consequences home
- Confronting questions the campaign has spent years creating

Then define the **season question** — a question play can genuinely
answer in more than one way:

> Who will control the passage through the Mid-Chain?

> What kind of power will the party become once nations can no longer
> ignore them?

## Transitions

A season does not need a predetermined finale. Identify plausible
**transition conditions** instead:

- A local conflict becomes impossible for regional powers to ignore
- The party chooses a factional alignment
- An unexplored region becomes accessible
- One dominant threat is neutralized, transformed, or abandoned
- The party's power outgrows previous constraints
- Accumulated faction responses change the political landscape
- A hidden layer of the setting becomes relevant

Multiple conditions may exist. A season may also end early, last longer,
split, merge, or be bypassed entirely.

Every planned season must evolve into the next phase through more than
one plausible campaign state.
