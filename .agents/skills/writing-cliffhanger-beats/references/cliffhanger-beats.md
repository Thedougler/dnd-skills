# Cliffhanger Beat Reference

Reference for designing, calibrating, and repairing Cliffhanger beats.

The operational skill lives in `../SKILL.md`. This file owns the detailed Cliffhanger model so the main workflow stays short and predictable.

## Cliffhanger semantics

A Cliffhanger in this framework is the *Scripting the Game* beat: an action-oriented contest, conflict, confrontation, hazard, pursuit, or peril whose outcome remains uncertain through play.

It is **not inherently a scene that ends unresolved**.

An Ending Cliffhanger used after the Climax is a Resolution pattern and belongs to the Resolution workflow.

### Cliffhanger versus Development

Classify by the scene's dramatic engine.

**Cliffhanger** — the engine is an uncertain contest or physical peril: chase, pursuit, race, battle, duel, ambush, dangerous obstacle, confrontation, or similar action.

**Development** — the engine is a change in knowledge, relationship, capability, opportunity, or situation.

*Scripting the Game* classifies **Confrontation** as a Cliffhanger even though it can be verbal: its engine is an uncertain contest of intimidation and dominance rather than information or relationship development.

Player action can transform one category into another at runtime. Prep the initial situation honestly and let actual play decide what happens.

---

## The Contract chain

Build every Cliffhanger as:

**Gravity → Ignition → Pressure → Vectors → Escalation → Fallout → Handoff**

- **Gravity** — why the characters already care.
- **Ignition** — what makes the danger immediate now.
- **Pressure** — what active force makes inaction costly.
- **Vectors** — materially different ways the players can engage.
- **Escalation** — how the situation worsens while unresolved.
- **Fallout** — how the world changes according to what happens.
- **Handoff** — the changed state from which a Development can emerge.

These are semantic requirements, not mandatory page headings. Map them into the repository's canonical beat template.

---

## Source ownership

Keep each fact in one authoritative place.

- The repository's **Cliffhanger/beat template** owns file schema and required frontmatter.
- Canonical **vault pages** own lore, NPC facts, locations, factions, items, relationships, and current state.
- The campaign's current player-gravity material owns established PC goals, fears, backstory investments, and other gravity anchors.
- `cliffhanger-patterns.md` owns Cliffhanger pattern definitions and pattern-specific design checks.
- The skill owns the **creation, revision, and review process**.

Link or embed authoritative material instead of copying it into the beat.

If the repository disagrees with this skill about page structure, preserve the repository's current template and map this skill's semantic requirements into it.

---

## Core principles

### Situation, not sequence

Prepare **what is happening**, **who wants what**, **what happens if nobody stops them**, and **what changes under pressure**.

Leave the players' solution unwritten.

A strong Cliffhanger can survive the PCs:

- attacking;
- fleeing;
- bargaining;
- hiding;
- splitting up;
- surrendering;
- using an unexpected ability;
- recruiting another faction;
- changing the objective;
- bypassing the encounter entirely.

The prepared material describes a responsive situation, not a screenplay of player actions.

### Irrigation

Players choose the route.

Prep shapes the terrain.

Use obstacles, threats, enemies, obligations, and opportunities attached to things the characters already care about. The resulting dramatic shape should emerge because meaningful pressures lie along paths the characters authentically want to travel.

When players leave the prepared channel, follow them.

Re-orchestrate from the resulting world state rather than moving the prepared encounter in front of them again.

### Gravity

Every prepared Cliffhanger needs a **Link of Relevance** to at least one established player investment.

Prefer, in order:

1. an explicit current player-gravity anchor;
2. a PC's established goal, fear, backstory, relationship, oath, or unresolved personal stake;
3. a party goal the players have demonstrated through play;
4. consequences created directly by a prior player choice.

Retrieve the anchor from the vault.

Do not manufacture a new backstory connection merely to justify the encounter.

A world-level danger can still carry Gravity when its immediate stakes intersect something the characters have already demonstrated they value.

### Honest opposition

Opposition pursues its own objectives according to the fiction.

It does not exist solely to provide a fight.

Know:

- what it wants **now**;
- what it is willing to risk;
- what it fears;
- what would make it withdraw, bargain, redirect, or escalate;
- what it does if the PCs never engage.

This makes unexpected player choices adjudicable without scripting branches for every possibility.

### Real defeat

Cliffhangers need credible risk.

Defeat need not mean PC death. It may mean:

- the quarry escapes;
- the enemy reaches the objective first;
- an ally is taken;
- evidence is destroyed;
- territory changes hands;
- resources are lost;
- the party is separated;
- a faction gains leverage;
- the PCs are captured;
- time runs out;
- the situation becomes worse.

The danger is meaningful when failure changes the campaign state.

### Escalation

Keep Cliffhangers **focused, dangerous, and consequential**.

Early action establishes capabilities.

Later action raises the ante.

Repeated conflicts against the same opposition should expose increasingly serious resources, tactics, champions, leverage, environments, or objectives rather than repeating the same encounter at a larger hit-point total.

Save the campaign situation's strongest pressure for the approach to the Climax.

---

## Opposition design

Write opposition as **intent + means + limits**.

For each important active force, establish:

- **Intent** — what it wants.
- **Means** — what it can credibly do.
- **Limits** — what constrains its choices.

Add:

- withdrawal condition when relevant;
- escalation trigger when relevant;
- bargaining leverage when relevant.

This gives the DM a compact behavioral model that remains useful after the first unexpected player action.

Named NPCs should retain motives from their canonical pages rather than receiving replacement motives solely to make the encounter function.

---

## Threat calibration

Calibrate for **credible uncertainty**, not predetermined victory.

A Cliffhanger should make the table reasonably uncertain about some meaningful outcome.

That uncertainty can concern:

- survival;
- capture;
- escape;
- objective control;
- time;
- collateral damage;
- secrecy;
- evidence;
- political standing;
- ally safety;
- resources.

Escalate later Cliffhangers above earlier ones in **consequence and commitment**, not merely numerical difficulty.

When system-specific encounter balance matters, use the repository's current mechanics/tooling as the authority. This skill determines dramatic function, not encounter math. When opposition needs new 5e mechanics, invoke `writing-statblocks`.

---

## Sandbox continuity

### Bypass is play

When the PCs evade a prepared Cliffhanger, determine what the active force accomplishes without them.

Record the resulting state.

Do not relocate the same encounter to the players' next destination merely because it was prepared.

### Premature victory is play

When the PCs neutralize a threat earlier or more decisively than expected, preserve the victory.

Advance the world from that result.

Do not restore the defeated threat solely to recover the planned beat sequence.

### Unexpected alliance is play

When PCs bargain with, recruit, blackmail, redeem, surrender to, or otherwise transform an opposing force, update that force's current relationship and objective from the fiction.

Do not preserve its encounter role after its fictional role has changed.

### Sequence drift is play

Players can skip, merge, reverse, or transform prepared beats.

After significant drift:

1. establish current canon;
2. identify the unresolved dramatic question;
3. identify current Gravity;
4. decide whether the next useful pressure is Development, Cliffhanger, or movement toward Climax;
5. prepare from there.

The Beat Chart is a pacing instrument.

It is not a recovery rail.

---

## Runtime payload

Regardless of template layout, the completed Cliffhanger must make these answers cheaply recoverable:

- **Situation** — what dangerous thing is happening **right now**?
- **Link of Relevance** — which established player investment gives this pressure Gravity?
- **Active Force** — who or what is driving the danger?
- **Objective** — what does that force want before the PCs interfere?
- **Stakes** — what can materially change here?
- **Ignition** — what makes action immediate?
- **Vectors** — what materially different approaches are already visible in the fiction?
- **Escalation** — what worsens while the situation remains unresolved?
- **Fallout** — what world states plausibly follow success, complication, setback, or bypass?
- **Handoff** — what changed state can feed the next Development?

The repository template may name or distribute these differently. Preserve the template rather than duplicating headings.

---

## DM-facing body contract

Use the repository's existing frontmatter template. The following contract governs the body.

```markdown
# <Cliffhanger Title>

## Situation

<What dangerous thing is happening right now. Lead with the immediate pressure, not the backstory. Keep this usable as the DM's opening frame.>

## Player Gravity

- [[PC]] — <established investment> → <why this Cliffhanger touches it>
- [[PC]] — <optional additional Link of Relevance>

## Active Force

- **Intent:** <what it wants>
- **Means:** <what it can credibly do>
- **Limits:** <what constrains it>

## Pressure

- **Now:** <what makes the situation active>
- **Next:** <what changes if time passes>
- **Default trajectory:** <what happens if the PCs do nothing>

## Open Vectors

These are prep coverage, not a player-facing menu.

- **<approach class>:** <what part of the prepared world supports it>
- **<approach class>:** <what part of the prepared world supports it>
- **<approach class>:** <what part of the prepared world supports it>

## Escalation

1. <current pressure>
2. <opposition commits stronger resource>
3. <environment/objective deteriorates>
4. <irreversible consequence approaches>

## Fallout

- **Success:** <what changes if PCs substantially achieve their objective>
- **Complication:** <what changes if they achieve it at significant cost>
- **Setback:** <what changes if the opposing force substantially succeeds>
- **Bypass:** <what happens if PCs avoid the confrontation>

## Handoff

**Likely:** [[Development Beat]] — <how pressure changes texture>

**Alternate:** <different transition created by a materially different player response>
```

### Runtime compression

The DM-facing note is an execution surface, not a design essay.

Prioritize:

1. what is happening;
2. why the party cares;
3. what the active force wants;
4. immediate danger;
5. escalation;
6. likely consequences.

Keep tactical information adjacent to the force that uses it.

Keep revelations adjacent to the trigger that exposes them.

Use short bullets where lookup speed matters.

Use prose where causal explanation matters.

Do not explain generic GM technique inside the runtime note.

The skill explains the method; the beat note contains the situation.

Keep extensive biography, faction history, location description, mechanics, and reusable lore on their owning pages and reach them with `[[wikilinks]]` or precise embeds.

The beat page owns only what is unique to **this occurrence of this situation**.

---

## Workflow detail

Expanded guidance for SKILL.md steps that compress heavy content.

### Ignition

Define the event or state that turns potential danger into **immediate action**.

Start as late as practical.

Good Ignition is observable:

- the gate begins closing;
- the assassin draws;
- the quarry bolts;
- the bridge gives way;
- the rival ship clears the headland;
- the ward cracks;
- the guards recognize the fugitive;
- the monster breaches the floor;
- negotiations reach an ultimatum.

Avoid requiring a specific player action to ignite the prepared beat.

Prefer pressures already in motion.

### Pressure fields

Record:

- **active force** — person, faction, creature, environment, clock, or combination;
- **objective** — what that force is trying to accomplish;
- **immediate stakes** — what can be lost here;
- **default trajectory** — what happens if the PCs do nothing;
- **constraints** — terrain, time, visibility, law, ritual, civilians, resources, or other conditions that materially shape play.

Pressure should advance without waiting politely for the PCs.

A timer can be literal or fictional. The important property is that unresolved danger changes.

### Vector families

Possible vector families include:

- direct force;
- movement or escape;
- deception;
- negotiation;
- environmental manipulation;
- protection or rescue;
- interception;
- sabotage;
- pursuit;
- surrender;
- sacrifice of one objective to preserve another;
- use of allies or faction leverage.

Only include vectors actually supported by the situation.

The **Water test**:

> If the players take the fastest route toward what they want, does the prepared situation still work?

If the answer depends on them choosing the "intended" solution, redesign the pressure.

### Escalation design

Create a short escalation ladder using **state changes**, not a predetermined round-by-round script.

A useful ladder usually contains 2–4 thresholds such as:

1. current pressure;
2. opposition commits a stronger resource;
3. environment/objective deteriorates;
4. irreversible consequence approaches.

Escalation may increase:

- force;
- exposure;
- positional danger;
- urgency;
- collateral stakes;
- political consequences;
- resource expenditure;
- separation;
- enemy commitment;
- information revealed through action.

Escalation should follow understandable causes.

The DM can skip, accelerate, reverse, or replace thresholds when play changes the fiction.

### Fallout result classes

Cover four result classes:

**Success** — what changes if the PCs substantially achieve their immediate objective.

**Complication** — what changes if they achieve it at a significant cost, or achieve only part.

**Setback** — what changes if the opposing force substantially succeeds.

**Bypass** — what happens if the PCs avoid the confrontation or pursue another priority.

Do not decide which result occurs.

Each result should alter at least one meaningful campaign state: location, position, possession, information, relationship, faction status, threat, clock, resource, or objective.

Where a result merely says "the PCs continue," the Cliffhanger has probably failed to matter.

### Handoff design

A Cliffhanger's job is not merely to spend hit points.

It changes the situation so the next **Development** has something worth interpreting.

Identify what becomes newly available for Development:

- a clue exposed during the struggle;
- a captured enemy who can talk;
- an ally whose behavior now matters;
- a newly visible weakness;
- a changed relationship;
- the consequences of a loss;
- a location newly reached;
- an enemy retreat;
- a warning;
- evidence recovered or destroyed;
- a decision made meaningful by the action.

Phrase the Handoff as **state**, not scheduled scene.

---

## Revision protocol

When revising an existing Cliffhanger:

1. retrieve its current canonical dependencies;
2. identify which Contract elements are already strong;
3. preserve working material;
4. repair missing Gravity, agency, pressure, escalation, Fallout, or Handoff;
5. remove assumptions invalidated by later canon;
6. replace scripted player behavior with active-force state;
7. re-run acceptance and repository validation.

Prefer a surgical repair over rewriting the entire note.

**Done when:** every change is necessary to restore the Contract or current canon and no unaffected content was churned.

---

## Review protocol

When asked to review without revising, do not edit.

Report findings under:

- **Classification**
- **Gravity**
- **Agency**
- **Pressure**
- **Escalation**
- **Fallout**
- **Handoff**
- **Vault Integrity**
- **Placement**
- **Verdict**

For each failing item:

1. cite the exact problematic field or passage;
2. state the violated contract;
3. describe the smallest repair.

Separate structural defects from optional improvements.

**Done when:** every acceptance criterion has an explicit pass, fail, or not-applicable determination.

---

## Classification and routing

Route the work elsewhere when its dramatic function belongs to another beat.

### Route to Hook

The primary job is getting otherwise-unengaged PCs into the adventure.

A Hook may itself use Cliffhanger machinery, but Hook owns the opening function.

### Route to Development

The primary job is revelation, conversation, warning, relationship change, clue delivery, alliance, planning, interpretation, or another non-action advancement.

### Route to Climax

The scene resolves the adventure's central dramatic question.

An action-heavy scene is not automatically a Cliffhanger if it is the decisive finale.

### Route to Resolution

The central conflict is already decided and the scene primarily applies aftermath.

An **Ending Cliffhanger** after the Climax is a Resolution pattern.

---

## Quality gate

A Cliffhanger is complete only when all applicable checks pass.

- [ ] The beat is correctly classified as action/peril rather than Development, Climax, or Resolution.
- [ ] Its authored placement preserves Development ↔ Cliffhanger rhythm unless current play has already changed the sequence.
- [ ] It has an explicit Link of Relevance to established player Gravity.
- [ ] Its Ignition creates immediate pressure without requiring a prescribed PC action.
- [ ] The active force has an objective independent of the PCs' expected solution.
- [ ] Inaction has a clear default trajectory.
- [ ] At least three materially distinct action vectors are supported by the fiction.
- [ ] The situation remains adjudicable when players choose an unprepared approach.
- [ ] Defeat or failure can produce a meaningful non-terminal campaign state.
- [ ] Escalation increases pressure through state changes rather than a scripted sequence.
- [ ] Success, complication, setback, and bypass each have intelligible Fallout.
- [ ] The beat changes campaign state rather than merely consuming resources.
- [ ] The Handoff creates material for Development without dictating the PCs' next action.
- [ ] Opposition behavior follows established motives and fictional constraints.
- [ ] Repeated opposition is meaningfully escalated relative to earlier encounters.
- [ ] Canonical lore is linked or embedded rather than duplicated.
- [ ] The canonical beat template and frontmatter conventions are preserved.
- [ ] Internal links use Obsidian wikilinks.
- [ ] The runtime surface is scannable by an expert human DM.
- [ ] Required repository validation passes.

## Governing principle

**Put pressure on what the characters care about, then let them decide where the water goes.**

A Cliffhanger supplies danger, motion, consequence, and uncertainty.

The players supply the path.

---

## Reference basis

This framework combines two compatible models.

### Beat function

*Scripting the Game* defines the Cliffhanger as the action-oriented beat and treats its purpose as uncertain physical or coercive contest. It provides a catalogue of pressure patterns (Chase, Pursuit, Race, Fist Fight, Dogfight, Confrontation, Duel, Battle, Monster, Ambush, Obstacle, Contest, Skirmish) and recommends alternating Cliffhangers with Developments for pacing. The pattern catalogue lives in `cliffhanger-patterns.md`.

### Player gravity and agency

The supplied Brennan Lee Mulligan material frames players as pursuing the routes that make sense to their characters while the GM shapes the surrounding terrain. Preparation becomes reliable when conflicts and obstacles attach to things the characters already care about. Backstory, goals, and fears therefore provide reliable gravity without converting the resulting route into a rail.

The operational synthesis used by this skill is:

> **Put pressure on what they care about. Leave the route open.**
